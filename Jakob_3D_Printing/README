Files in this directory created as part of the Hackathon. They should be close
to what is needed for 3D printing of the Jakobshavn's Isbrea region of West
Central Greenland. See the modified README on the github site for a description
of the process used to create the files. Essentially it is:

Download netcdf -> Import into QGIS -> Save black and white images of surface
and bed -> convert to stl with hmstl -> difference and intersections with
OpenSCAD (Alex)

All .png and .stl files are here, except for the thickness of ice file, which
would rest on the bedrock. Note jakobshavns_bed_colors.png is a suggested file
for applying colors to the bed model.
